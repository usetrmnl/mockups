# TRMNL Mockups
this repo is a growing collection of assets with which to create high quality device renders.

since GitHub is not designed for storage, we'll put larger files in places like Google Drive.

community contributions are welcome.

#### Quickstart

1. download a plugin screen from your [TRMNL Playlist](https://usetrmnl.comm/playlists) (right-click > "Save Image As...")
2. download any `*.psd` file from the collection below
3. open the file in Photoshop, Affinity, or free on the web at photopea.com
4. double-click the small square inside the layer named "Plugins" - this will look a bit different in each file
5. drag/drop your plugin screen as the top or only visible layer, then save the Smart Object "plugins.psd" window
6. the mockup file (step 2) will super-impose your plugin screen; modify and export to your liking
